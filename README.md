# Pok√©mon Brawl
The pok√©mon are meeting tonight to find out the best brawler composition.

Help them by choosing two teams of 6 pok√©mon and find out who is the last one standing!

# How to play
- Pick a team of 6 pok√©mon
- Pick another team of 6 pok√©mon or let the AI decide
- Watch them fight and see who is the last pok√©mon standing

# Why did you do this?
I was just wandering the internet coding community and I found motivation in [July's Codepen challenge](https://codepen.io/challenges/2019/july/3).

Down at the bottom where resources are recommended, they mentioned [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/)

So after brainstorming for a week I started coding some kind of little card videogame using this API and just plain vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.

After three weeks and moving out in between, I released the first version of the videogame on July 18th 2019.

It featured:
- How to play instructions
- Two team player selection
- Random AI and _pretty_ smart AI
- Shuffling decks
- Turning cards
- Combat animations
- Winner SVG and üéâ animation

# Ash
So if you come here wondering how Ash thinks before picking the right pok√©mons to beat you, here is what is happening on his mind.

He asigns a value to each remaining pok√©mon considering its stats, that is Attack, Defense, HP, Speed and types. Then he orders all the pok√©mons based on that value, and picks the strongest 6.

In order to crush you, he focuses on finding the pok√©mons with the right types. He calculates the _average_ type multiplier of every pok√©mon left against the pok√©mons on your team. This average is added to the previous calculation.

That is why if you have a FIRE type team, Ash is smart enough to pick mainly water pok√©mons.

# Brawling algorithm
First the speed is considered to find the pok√©mon that will deal dmg first.

The a multiplier is calculated based on the attacker and defender types.

Finally, it is basically just 

```Javascript
defender.hp = defender.hp - ((attacker.attack - defender.defense) * multiplier)
```

But when both pok√©mons are tied, they are given a high chance to at least deal a little damage and finish their opponent

```Javascript 
if (attacker.attack - defender.defense <= -40) {
    // [0,1]
    dmg = Math.round(Math.random())
} else if (attacker.attack - defender.defense <= 0) {
    // [1,multiplier]
    dmg = Math.round(Math.random() * multiplier) + 1
} else if (attacker.attack - defender.defense <= 3) {
    // [1,multiplier * 3]
    dmg = Math.round(Math.random() * 3 * multiplier) + 1
} else {
    // basic case
    dmg = Math.round((attacker.attack - defender.defense) * multiplier)
}
defender.hp = Math.round((defender.hp - dmg))
```

# Techy stuff
- Website made just of HTML, JS and CSS
- Favicon generated thanks to [https://realfavicongenerator.net/]
- Pok√©mon landing image in base64
- PokeApi data downloaded, formatted and pasted right away in JS
- Pok√©mon sprites and type images are downloaded in runtime
- Custom SVG made in Sketch for the winner animation
- Just using 3 external resources: Pok√©Api, GoogleFonts and GoogleAnalytics

In case you want to simulate a brawl, just paste this on the DevTools

```Javascript
(function simulate() {
    document.querySelector('#step0-button').click();
    document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="1"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="2"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="3"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="4"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="5"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step1 [data-id="6"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step1-button').click();
    document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="7"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="8"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="9"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="10"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="11"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step2 [data-id="12"]').click();
    document.querySelector('#step2-button').click();
})();
```

In case you want to get the pok√©mons ordered by its _Ash value_, just call this function with any array of pok√©mons. For instance

```Javascript
orderPokemonsByExpectedValue(pokemons)
```
